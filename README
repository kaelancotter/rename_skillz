This is a basic case renaming assignment as discussed for the CIC skills development presentations.
The following 4 functions rename_case need to be implemented:

is_case_in_path(path, case)
find_files_with_case(parent_folder, case)
replace_case(path, old_case, new_case)
rename_file(src, dst, create_folders=False)

Results can be checked by running the included rename_case_test.py tests
